1.Introduction to Functional programming
----------------------------------------

What is a functional interface

functional interface is an interface which contains one and only one abstract method


1.1  What is Functional Programming
----------------------------------

Functional programming is a paradigm that allows programming using expressions
 i.e. declaring functions, passing functions as arguments and using functions 
as statements (rightly called expressions in Java8).

1.2.Advantages of Functional programming:
---------------------------------------
 code is more concise, less complex, more predictable, and easier to test compared
 to the legacy style of coding.

1.3.Functional Interfaces catogeries
--------------------------------
All functional interfaces belong to the api java.util.function.

1.Suppliers
It's get() method never takes any argument but always return something

2.Consumers
It's accpt() method always takes an argument and never return anything

3.Predicates
It's test() method takes a value does a logical test and returns true or false.

4.Functions
It's apply() method takes an argument and returns a value.
